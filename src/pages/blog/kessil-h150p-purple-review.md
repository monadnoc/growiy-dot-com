The Kessil brand is a subsidiary of DiCon FiberOptics. Their 'dense matrix led' technology claims better light penetration, which is a claim we have yet to test on plant canopies. Currently, the H150 is discontinued for newer models. The model tested here is the 'purple' ('magenta' recommended for flowering) and as a disclaimer, it already had 4 years of moderate use at the time of testing.

Among the many factors to consider when setting up your grow, choosing the right plant can be daunting. One major factor is whether to start from scratch with a seed or purchase a cloned plant to jumpstart the growing process. Growiy consultant Sam Rifkin weighs the pros and cons of each:



Every strain grows differently, and there is a lot of murkiness around breed verification in today’s cannabis industry. Therefore, it is difficult to guarantee exactly the strain you are growing without a genetic test -- whether you’re growing a seed or a clone.



However, by growing clones, which are grown from the cutting of another plant, you’ll know that it’s exactly the same strain as the previous plant. Starting with a clone accelerates the growing process by bypassing the seed stage. On the downside, clones use old cellular material, which will degrade -- just like Dolly the sheep. Another danger is not being able to guarantee the plant’s growing conditions, and it may come with mites, mildew or other pathogens that could contaminate the rest of your grow. 



Because of the DNA mixing that occurs naturally during pollination, growing a seed will always be a surprise. Also, you’ll need an extra month of grow time compared to a clone. But there are several advantages to starting with a seed. Growth can be more vigorous because seeds have taproots that go deeper, and they have the potential to grow larger outdoors.

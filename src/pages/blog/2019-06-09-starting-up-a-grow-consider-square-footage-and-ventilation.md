Consider whether to grow inside or outside. Calculate the entire square footage of space you need, including access paths to get to your garden. If you want to grow outside, doing it outside of an urban area is less stressful than trying to do it in the city. 



Another major factor is legalities of growing inside and outside, so check with your local legislation. In California, people over 21 can own six plants. There are different limits with medical patients. On 5 acres, you can grow 100 square feet of canopy.



Your yield is calculated by square footage -- the number of plants you have is actually irrelevant. If youâ€™re just a hobby grower with an indoor space, you can theoretically grow 50 plants in a 100 square foot space.



If you have height limitations in your indoor grow, you can make your plants grow short. Some strains such as Sour Diesel and OG have the propensity to grow tall, but topping the plant by removing its tip will cause the offshoots of the plant to grow out. Any strain is appropriate to grow indoors given the right training and pruning.



People have a tendency to grow indica indoors due to its short height and short flower time, as the shorter grow time means a lower energy bill.

Spider mites eat cannabis buds, which stop them from growing. They can destroy your entire grow if the proper measures are not taken. Growiy consultant Sam Rifkin explains how to detect and manage a spider mite outbreak.



Spider mites are very small, but you can detect them by white spots on your plant’s leaves when they lay eggs on the leaves’ underside. These spots are damaging to the leaves as they impede the plant’s ability to photosynthesize.



Keep note that anything you use on your plant will stay in the plant, including pesticides. It is dangerous to your health to use pesticides to tackle spider mites. If your plant is still in the vegetative stage, spray the entire plant several times a day with a mix of 15 ML alcohol and 10 ML Dr. Bronner’s soap per gallon. You can use atomizers or pump sprayers. This mix will kill eggs and mites. However, it is not a systemic spray, so you must coat the plant regularly until every bug has been killed.

Alternatively, you can dip a plant directly into a bucket of this mixture. The plant may react and look different afterward, but it will recover. 

If the problem has not abated after one week of treatment, consider releasing predatory mites -- mites that eat other mites. Predatory mites, such as Neocalifornicus persimilis, will die quickly if they don’t have a rapid supply of food -- and even eat each other if they are kept in the same container. Therefore, they are highly effective in controlling a spider mite outbreak, and may even prevent future occurrences if they can stay alive. They are more likely to survive in an organic environment with soil than in a sterilized environment.



If you don’t treat spider mites, they will form webs and breed rapidly. You can vacuum the webs off the plant, but this can cause damage. This is essentially the point of no return when you should cut your losses and discard the plant.



If your plants are already in the flowering stage, it is incredibly difficult to fight them. The best treatment is prevention with careful maintenance.

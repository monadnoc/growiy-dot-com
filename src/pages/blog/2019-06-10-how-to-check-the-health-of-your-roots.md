Beneath a healthy plant are healthy roots. Just because they’re out of sight does not mean they should be out of mind. Growiy consultant gives tips on how to check your roots’ health:



If you’re using a pot, simply flip the pot over. If the cannabis plant has rooted into the soil, you can pop it out of the pot. Healthy roots should look white, with fuzzy white hairs growing on them. 



If roots look brown or slimy, that’s a sign of root stress, which should be treated.



If the roots are circling themselves, that is a sign the plant is becoming root-bound after being in the same pot for too long. Roots are searching for places to grow.



If the plant is root-bound, transfer the plant into a bigger pot. First, use your fingers to loosen up knots in the root. In the new pot, decompress the dirt and homogenize the soil texture to prevent dry spots in the new soil. Place the plant in the new pot so roots face outward, ensuring they can start growing into the soil right away.

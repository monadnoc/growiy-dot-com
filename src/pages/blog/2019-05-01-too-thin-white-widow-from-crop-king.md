Dear Growiy,<br>
I'm having the following problems with my White Widow clones originally from Crop King Seeds:
* lacking plant density.
* only about 12 inches high.
* have fan and full spectrum grow light.
* larger leaves fall off, and side shoots refuse to grow much
* fertilize once/week with 20-20-20 NPK (triple 20)

Please advise,<br>

## If you build out the base, the top will come
Hi *DMMAW-WW*,

**Our suggested action**: transplant them to a bigger pot and ['top' the plants](https://www.leafly.com/news/growing/how-to-top-cannabis-plants-for-better-yields). Topping the plants right after transplanting can promote root growth, but since these plants are already dropping leaves, you may want to wait a day or too to minimize stress in the transplant.

*The size of the new container should ideally be as wide as you want the plants to be tall.* That is, if you want them to be 2 feet tall, give them two feet wide containers&mdash;better yet, plant them all two feet apart (in this example) in a single bed of soil (referred to more generally as a 'raised bed').

Since you already have a fan and a full spectrum light, you've got the right idea!
Most people forget to use a fans to toughen up their new plants, but with regards to the light, it's not just about the light spectrum: please make sure you have *enough* light. Not having enough light will cause your plants to grow tall and skinny to 'reach' for it.
Lastly, You may need to get these babies in a contained environment or tent where you can better control and monitor the humidity&mdash;"larger leaves fall[ing] off" may be from lack of humidity; the old leaves are always the first to respond when there is an issue with your grow.

The act of 'topping' and pruning your plants is more of an art than a science, and it requires a good sense of the canopy size and height you are trying to build for your personal space.

Grow it yourself, don't grow it alone,<br>

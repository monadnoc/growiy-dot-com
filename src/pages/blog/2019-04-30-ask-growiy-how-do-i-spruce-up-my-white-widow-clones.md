title: 'Ask Growiy: How do I spruce up my White Widow clones?'

  Question: How do I get my 6 week clones of White Widow to get beefier and
  leafier? Obviously I have to transplant them yet, but they seem so frail even
  though they have full spectrum daylight bulbs on them. I fertilize once a week
  with triple 20.

Growiy's experts say to use a fan. Cannabis plants indoors need natural stimulus that simulates outdoor environment--wind is key. A normal house fan blowing from left to right should help. Establishing a thicker canopy will also require pruning and training plants or bending down with string.

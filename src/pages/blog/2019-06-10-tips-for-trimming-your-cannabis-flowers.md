After a long process of growing your cannabis plants, it would be a shame to ruin the harvest in the trimming process. Growiy consultant Sam Rifkin shares tips on curing and drying your grow.



The time at which your plant is ready to harvest depends on what strain and type of plant you are growing. Sour diesel needs 9-10 weeks of flower time. Clones need one month of vegetation before flowering.

Dry the cannabis as best as you can for one week. The grow room is an ideal place to do this as it should already be well ventilated.

Cut the cannabis down and hang them on lines with ample space between them. This helps to prevent bruising the flowers, which may lead to crystals falling off or lowering the flowers’ visual appeal. 

Point a space heater to the trimmings with an exhaust fan or dehumidifier nearby. The heater will accelerate evaporation, while the dehumidifier will dry out the atmosphere. Humidity in the room will increase the risk of mold infecting the plants, which would be more dangerous to humans than mildew.

After one week, bend the stems on the plant. If buds are dry and won’t squish, cut the branch off the stem. Cut into 6-inch pieces. Place them a mesh hanger like a laundry bag with cubbies.

If you are in a dry area, cannabis will dry out quickly. If your environment is humid, cannabis will never dry out. 

Wet trimming is both difficult for the trimmer and hard on the bud. When you trim, they should separate easily with minimal use of scissors.

Buds have a delicate crystal structure, so be delicate to avoid squishing them. In the side that’s toward you, drag a pair of Japanese pruning scissors around the bud, grazing it. If it is dry enough, you should be able to pull the scissors off without having to snip off every leaf. Hover scissors over bud by a few millimeters, without touching the buds. Otherwise scissors get sticky and messy.

While cannabis growing can be a productive experience, there are many pitfalls that early growers often succumb to. Growiy consultant Sam Rifkin outlines a few common mistakes:



Setup

The most important time to ensure a successful grow is in your preparation. If your room or plant medium are not set up correctly, this will affect the full growing cycle.



Flowering

The vegetative state is more forgiving to growing mistakes. But in the flowering stage, if plants start wilting or get sprayed with something wrong, they will hermaphrodite -- meaning, they will pollinate and start growing seeds. 



Light leaks

Plants need a 12-hour period of pure darkness to prevent pollination. If light leaks onto them at a certain time of day, they will grow male pollen sacs. If pollen touches a female bud, it will start to grow seeds. 



Overfertilization

Some cannabis fertilizers that promise huge buds are highly aggressive, and overdosing the plant can cause the stems to turn yellow and burn up the plant.



Pesticides

If you panic at the sight of mold or mites and spray your plant with a pesticide, you could be introducing toxins to your plant that would be dangerous for you to consume in the end product.



The key to fixing growing mistakes is to stay calm and donâ€™t act impulsively. Become informed about the problem and do what is best for the plant.
